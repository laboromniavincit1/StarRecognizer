# StarRecognizer

StarRecognizer is a celebrity recognition project utilizing the VGG16 model through transfer learning with Keras. The model is trained on a dataset featuring images of four celebrities: Alexandra Daddario, Johnny Depp, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Narendra Modi. Achieving an accuracy of 94-95%, the model predicts which celebrity corresponds to a given photo. The project also includes a user-friendly webpage built with HTML, CSS, and Flask, allowing users to upload photos and receive predictions about the recognized celebrity.
